## Features

- **Easy to Use**: The module is designed with simplicity in mind. You can integrate it into your projects without hassle.
- **Efficient**: The A-star algorithm is one of the most efficient pathfinding algorithms available, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Customizable**: You can modify the heuristic function to suit your specific needs.
- **Supports Diagonal Movement**: The module can handle diagonal movements, allowing for more natural pathfinding in grid-based environments.

## Installation

To install the Pathfinding module, you can clone this repository or download the latest release. To download, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/alter15926/pathfinding/releases). 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alter15926/pathfinding.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd pathfinding
```

You can then install the required dependencies. If you are using Python, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Using the Pathfinding module is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```python
from pathfinding import AStar

# Define your grid
grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
]

# Create an instance of the AStar class
pathfinder = AStar(grid)

# Find the path from start to end
start = (0, 0)
end = (3, 3)
path = pathfinder.find_path(start, end)

print("Path found:", path)
```

### Parameters

- **grid**: A 2D list representing the grid where `0` is a walkable cell and `1` is an obstacle.
- **start**: A tuple representing the starting point in the grid.
- **end**: A tuple representing the endpoint in the grid.

### Return Value

The `find_path` method returns a list of tuples representing the path from the start to the end point.

## Examples

Here are a few more examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the Pathfinding module:

### Example 1: Simple Grid

```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0]
]

pathfinder = AStar(grid)
path = pathfinder.find_path((0, 0), (3, 3))
print("Path found:", path)
```

### Example 2: Complex Obstacles

```python
grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]

pathfinder = AStar(grid)
path = pathfinder.find_path((0, 0), (4, 4))
print("Path found:", path)
```
